### How to use Chrome's memory profiler

First, open up Chrome's developer console :

* <kbd>CTRL</kbd>-<kbd>SHIFT</kbd>-<kbd>i</kbd> on Linux or Windows
* <kbd>&#8984;</kbd>-<kbd>&#8997;</kbd>-<kbd>i</kbd> on Mac
* Or just right-click on the page and choose "Inspect Element"

Next, head over to the Profiles tab.

### Your first heap snapshot

All three platforms for have subtly different interfaces to the profiling tools, so (currently) I won't be providing any screenshots -- hopefully this encourages you to actually follow along in your browser.

Take a snapshot right now, on this page.
On some platforms you have to click the icon that looks like an eye, and on others you have to choose a radio button that says something about "Heap Profiling" and then you have to click a button labeled "Start".
